# Mom-Village

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Software Engineering** course.
The goal of the project is to analyze, design, and demonstrate a software system
following standard software engineering methodologies.

## 🎯 Project Idea
Comprehensive Maternal and Child Health Support Platform The proposed project aims to design a software platform that supports women throughout their  pregnancy and postpartum journey, focusing on health, well-being, and informed decision-making  regarding both mother and child.
The system will act as a centralized, secure digital health hub that connects mothers with reliable 
medical information, personalized guidance, and professional consultation services, thereby bridging the 
gap between general maternal health advice and individualized care.
Also,it works as a reminder for baby vaccination during the vaccination cycle.

## 📋 Project Phases

### 1️⃣ Requirements Engineering
- Stakeholder identification
- Functional and Non-functional requirements
- Use case analysis

### 2️⃣ Traceability
- Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) to ensure full coverage
- Mapping requirements to design and implementation

### 3️⃣ System Design
- Architecture Design
- UML Diagrams:
  - Class Diagram
  - Sequence Diagram
- Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

### 4️⃣ Implementation (Demo)
- A prototype demo implemented using **Vibe Coding**
- The demo demonstrates core system functionalities

### 5️⃣ Testing
- Test cases derived from functional requirements
