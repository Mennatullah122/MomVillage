Comprehensive Maternal and Child Health Support Platform The proposed project aims to design a software platform that supports women throughout their  pregnancy and postpartum journey, focusing on health, well-being, and informed decision-making  regarding both mother and child.

The system will act as a centralized, secure digital health hub that connects mothers with reliable 
medical information, personalized guidance, and professional consultation services, thereby bridging the 
gap between general maternal health advice and individualized care.

The platform will enable mothers to create and manage detailed Mother and Baby Profiles, track critical 
data points such as pregnancy progress, postpartum recovery, and the baby's growth and vaccination 
schedule (specifically adhering to the Egyptian National Vaccination Schedule). It will provide 
automated, timely reminders for medications, vitamins, and appointments, ensuring proactive health 
management.

In addition, the system will serve as a specialized knowledge base, recommending safe nutrition plans, 
exercises, and medications, while providing necessary warnings on forbidden foods, cosmetics, and 
drugs. 
A core feature is the Doctor Consultation Service, which allows mothers to book online 
appointments, engage in secure chat, and receive professional advice from certified physicians. 
The platform will also provide crucial mental health support through depression awareness and self assessment tools.
